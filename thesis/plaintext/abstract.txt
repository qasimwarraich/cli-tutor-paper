Despite the arguably dated appearance, difficult learning curve and practical
non-existence in the modern personal computing space, Command Line Interfaces
(CLIs) have more than stood the test of time in the software development world.
There are a multitude of extremely popular tools and applications that
primarily focus on the command line as an interaction medium. Some examples
include version control software like git, compilers and interpreters for
programming languages, package managers and various core utilities that are
popular in areas such as software development, scripting and system
administration. Command line interfaces are also utilised in areas outside of
software development. For example, the infamous Bloomberg Terminal in the
financial sector and in general computing applications such as email e.g. mutt,
neomutt and text editing e.g. Vim, Neovim, Wordstar.

As mentioned before, the use of the command line as an interaction paradigm has
effectively disappeared from a mainstream personal computer usage perspective.
This reality contributes greatly to the intimidation factor and learning
difficulty for those interested in getting into software engineering or system
administration. This unfamiliarity, paired with the inevitability of usage of
CLIs in the development space, highlights a need to make the command line more
accessible to new users for whom text-based interaction with their computer is
an alien concept. In recent years, interactive learning tools utilising
features such as sandboxed environments have been gaining in popularity and
have the potential to be a suitable medium for learning command line basics
through actual usage, examples and practice.

In this work, we have created just such an interactive tutoring tool tailored
for the command line. CLI-Tutor is a forgiving CLI application that aims to
teach topics such as shell basics and Unix-like core utility usage through
the use of guided lessons with interactive examples and feedback.
