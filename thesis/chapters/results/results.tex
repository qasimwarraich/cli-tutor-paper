In this chapter, we will discuss the outcomes of this thesis work. We will look
into our findings in light of our research questions we defined in
\autoref{chap:intro} in \autoref{subsec:rqs}. Furthermore, we will divide our
results into two distinct sections, focusing on the results of the engineering
effort in building \textit{CLI-Tutor} and secondly, the findings from the user
study discussed in the preceding chapter.


\section{Engineering Results}

From an engineering perspective we managed to achieve almost all the
technical goals we set out for \textit{CLI-Tutor}. Design goals relating to
distributability were fulfilled as \textit{CLI-Tutor} is a single binary that
is easy to distribute and containerise. \textit{CLI-Tutor} also works natively
on  \textit{GNU/Linux} and  \textit{Macintosh} operating systems and thanks to
the associated web application and docker images for the tool, it is possible
to use \textit{CLI-Tutor} on almost any mainstream operating system. The web
application and ease of containerisation also helped achieve another goal of
creating a safe and forgiving sandboxed environment for users to experiment
with in.

This ease of experimentation and application of learnt skills is an
important factor when it comes to developing confidence with CLIs as they are a
foreign interaction paradigm to most novices. Ease of experimentation and
ability to apply learnt skills is not purely achievable through technical
design alone. The curriculum of \textit{CLI-Tutor} also reflects an emphasis on
giving the user space to try things out without worry or the tutorial software
actually getting in the way. One participant in the user study particularly
admired this: 

\begin{quotes}
    "I think the cli-tutor really provides the right amount of guidance, while
    leaving enough freedom to experiment and test things. Thus it was trivial to
    examine small questions one asks themselves like:  what would happen if one
    calls "rmdir" on a directory that contains another empty directory.  All in all
    a great experience, and a drastic improvement compared to non-interactive  2
    hour lectures."
\end{quotes}

Based, on feedback received by participants in the user study we can conclude
that the curriculum was well received and appropriately designed as many
respondents found this to be a particularly strong aspect of
\textit{CLI-Tutor}. 

\begin{quotes}
    "Very good tutorial, great work! It starts at the beginning and fills the gaps
    that are necessary to make working with the command line more quicker and more
    useful."
\end{quotes}

\begin{quotes}
    "It was overall very well structured. I feelt like the tutorial was a very
    smooth process, taking you from one topic to the most closely related next
    topic."
\end{quotes}

\begin{quotes}
"Great work, short but precise! I would love to do more of your tutorials :)"
\end{quotes}

The level of difficulty was also appropriate as many participants found the
course content appropriate for newcomers. This is encouraging as tutorial tools
are generally targeted at beginners and \textit{CLI-Tutor} is no exception. 

\begin{quotes}
    "Was a pleasent and well thought out lesson. Would recommend this for newcomers
    to the CLI, as it does have a friendly and fun tone to the entire teaching
    environment."
\end{quotes}

There were also multiple participants who particularly enjoyed the interactive
aspect \textit{CLI-Tutor}. This was of particular interest to use given our a
major intention of our research was to assess the effectiveness of interactive
learning tools for the command line.

\begin{quotes}
    "The cli-tutor made it really easy for me to learn how to use the command line
    in an uncomplicated way. The interactive part was the best part about the tool.
    It required me to directly put my understanding into practice, making the
    learning process very convenient."
\end{quotes}

Even when interactive style learning was not the preference of the participant,
as is the case with the participant below. They still were able to find some
merits in the interactive approach.

\begin{quotes}
    "i personally prefer to acquire knowledge first and then put it into practice on my own. but i
    think interactive learning is a very effective method for many people to learn new things.
    especially when it comes to something that triggers fear of contact (for example the cli, or git).
    the cli-tutor is a really cool tool, visually and in terms of content! the most important things are
    repeated more than once, and repetitions are very important for the learning effect."
\end{quotes}

\subsection{Relevant Research Questions}

\ref{rq:2} and \ref{rq:3} are technically orientated research questions. Based
on what we learnt in the feedback provided by participants in the user-study we
will now provide some insights into potential answers to these research questions.


% How should an interactive learning tool be designed to mitigate                        
% the difficulty and indimidation factor of learning CLIs? \label{rq:2}                  

                                                                                         
% How can a `forgiving' shell be implemented on top of an existing                       
% shell to enable the transition from learning to real-world usage? \label{rq:3}

\subsection{Relevant Research Questions}

\subsection{Intimidation Factors}

In the user study, participants were asked about intimidation factors regarding
command line usage in order to better understand the difficulties faced by
beginners in order to further improve \textit{CLI-Tutor} and any other future
research in the area of making command line interfaces more approachable.
