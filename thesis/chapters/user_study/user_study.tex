In order to test and validate the effectiveness of our solution, a user study
was conducted. The goal of this user study was two part. Firstly, we were
interested in assessing the usability and response to \textit{CLI-Tutor}.
Secondly, we wanted to ascertain if interactive learning would be a more
effective medium to teach command line interaction than the traditional means
such as online documentation or books. In this chapter, we will describe our
user study in detail.


\section{Methodology}

The user study for this thesis work was conducted remotely and asynchronously.
We designed an online survey using the \textit{LimeSurvey}\cite{schmitzlime}
tool made available to us by the University of Zurich.

The user study focused on the comparison between interactive learning
approaches such as that of \textit{CLI-Tutor} and traditional ones, which are
mostly reading based. In the modern software development space, online
documentation is the status quo and the medium we choose to compare our
solution against. As discussed in \autoref{chap:design}, \textit{CLI-Tutor}
uses \textit{Markdown} to specify lessons. Many static documentation generation
websites use Markdown files to generate documentation from. This is also true
for our chosen generator. This enables us to make objectively compare the
interaction medium rather than the lesson content, since the exact same lessons
can be used in both tools. Furthermore, due to the popularity of
\textit{MkDocs} it is a very realistic representation of documentation that
individuals may encounter in the wild.


\subsection{Interactive versus Non-interactive}




\subsection{Structure}


Our online survey was divided into the following sections:

\begin{itemize}

    \item User Familiarity: In this section users answered questions relating
        to their experience, interest and preferences to provide us with some
        information regarding each individual participant.

    \item Assignment: All participants where divided into one of two groups,
        interactive and non-interactive. The assignment value is unknown to the
        participant at the time of starting the survey. Our survey tool then
        conditionally rendered a URL for the participants to follow to the next
        section of the survey.

    \item Tutorial: At this stage, once the participants have been assigned to
        one of the two groups, they will either be sent to our web application
        running \textit{CLI-Tutor} or to our documentation website. If assigned
        to the non-interactive group

    \item Evaluation: The evaluation stage is where participants were asked a
        series of basic questions relating to the lessons they took in the
        previous stage.

    \item Feedback

    \item Feedback Opposite (optional)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assignment}

Assignment was achieved through the use of psuedorandom number generation, a
feature of \textit{LimeSurvey}.

\section{Participants}

In total, {XX} participatns took part in our user study. Recruitment was
primarily done through University channels though some participants were also
sourced through work email and word of mouth.




\section{Section} In addition to these two views, there is also a prompt to
enter an identifier when the program is first launched. This was only added to
the program to help identify log files for the user study conducted as a part
of this thesis work.
