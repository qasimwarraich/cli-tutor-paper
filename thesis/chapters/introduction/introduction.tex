\section{Problem Description}

To validate the tool and answer our
research questions, a user study will be conducted, most likely with bachelor's
students at the University of Zurich. A secondary goal is to embed the learning
tool into a prototypical web application in order to make it more accessible
and portable.
This tool aims to determine whether an interactive learning method may ease the
introduction into command line interfaces for novice users, particularly
mitigating the 'scare factor' experienced by first-time users.
