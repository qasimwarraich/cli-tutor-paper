\section{Problem Description}
This tool aims to determine whether an interactive learning method may ease the
introduction into command line interfaces for novice users, particularly
mitigating the 'scare factor' experienced by first-time users. We do so by
creating a forgiving CLI with the goal of teaching topics such as shell
scripting basics and Unix-like core utility usage through the use of
interactive examples. We draw inspiration from the
`vimtutor'\cite{pierce_ware_smith_moolenaar_2019} Figure \ref{vimtutor} utility
shipping alongside the popular terminal-based text editor Vim. The proposed
tool shall allow for opt-in analytics that are sent back to a data collection
service for the purpose of learning which mistakes are most commonly made, and
to improve the tool accordingly. To validate the tool and answer our research
questions, a user study will be conducted, most likely with bachelor's students
at the University of Zurich. A secondary goal is to embed the learning tool
into a prototypical web application in order to make it more accessible and
portable.
