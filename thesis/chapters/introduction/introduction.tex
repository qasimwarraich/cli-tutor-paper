Command line interfaces are still widely employed and being developed for a
variety of uses. Benefitting from their simplicity, Command line interfaces
allow for comparatively rapid development and the implementation of features
when compared to their graphical counterparts, which would require a much more
detailed and complicated implementation and more difficult user interface
considerations. Command line programs also further benefit from simplicity of
their textual nature when it comes to their ability to work with other
programs. The simple notion of textual input and output being the main forms of
interaction allow for an extremely flexible interface\footnote{In this case
"interface" describes a medium through which programs can communicate, not a
user interface.} for chaining tools together. This composition of programs is
referred to as piping ( SOME UNIX PHILOSOPHY MEME STUFF
HERE)\cite{mcilroy1978unix}. Since most command line applications share this
idea of textual input and output there isn't the need for bespoke mediums of
interaction to be developed and features can be more effectively shared across
programs.

Since CLI programs are run within a shell, which has direct access to the
underlying operating system, a tight integration between program and system is
formed. This tight coupling, paired with the low system resource requirements
and the ability to specify inputs and arguments via text and modify program
behaviour upon instantiation with flags opens the room for powerful batch
processing capabilities, easy automation and the ability to deal with large
amounts of input and output efficiently.

The learning curve to such systems is however a strong barrier to widespread
enjoyment of these benefits. For new users, this learning curve is made steeper
by the paradigm shift in the personal computing space towards graphical user
interfaces.

\section{Interactive Learning Tools} 

To validate the tool and answer our
research questions, a user study will be conducted, most likely with bachelor's
students at the University of Zurich. A secondary goal is to embed the learning
tool into a prototypical web application in order to make it more accessible
and portable. This tool aims to determine whether an interactive learning
method may ease the introduction into command line interfaces for novice users,
particularly mitigating the 'scare factor' experienced by first-time users.

\section{Requirements}


We preliminarily define the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Are there identifiable patterns of difficulty when it
          comes to adopting CLIs? Can the `indimidation factor' be pinned down?
    \item How should an interactive learning tool be designed to mitigate
          the difficulty and indimidation factor of learning CLIs?
    \item How can a `forgiving' shell be implemented on top of an existing
          shell to enable the transition from learning to real-world usage?
    \item Is the interactive tool more effective than text based learning methods?
    \item Are novice CLI users more likely to continue
          using CLI interfaces after using such a tool?
\end{itemize}
