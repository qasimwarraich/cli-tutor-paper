\subsection*{General thesis guidelines}

The typical rules of academic work must be followed. In
\cite{Bernstein2005-daguide}, Bernstein describes a number of guidelines which
must be followed. At the end of the thesis, a final report has to be
written. The report should clearly be organized, follow the usual academic
s.e.a.l. \LaTeX-template.

Since implementing software is also part of this thesis, state-of-the-art
design, coding, and documentation standards for the software have to be obeyed.

Effective feedback can only be provided to the student if the thesis draft is handed in well before the final deadline!

The diploma thesis has to be concluded with a final presentation for the members
of the Software Evolution and Architecture Lab (s.e.a.l.).
